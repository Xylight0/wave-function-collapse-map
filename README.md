# https://github.com/Xylight0/wave-function-collapse-map.gitWave Function Collapse (WFC) Project

## Overview

This project explores the concept of Wave Function Collapse (WFC) in the context of tile-based procedural generation. The WFC algorithm is implemented to generate diverse and realistic-looking patterns from a set of input tiles, showcasing its applications in computer graphics, game development, and procedural content generation.

## Features

* **Tile-based Generation:** Input a set of tiles with predefined patterns and let the WFC algorithm create complex, non-repetitive structures.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Adjust various parameters such as input tileset, output size, constraints, and output diversity to tailor the generation process.
* **Visualization Tools:** Visualize the generated output, explore different configurations, and analyze the WFC algorithm's behavior.
* **Integration Examples:** Includes integration examples and APIs for incorporating WFC-generated content into applications or games.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**

   * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Xylight0/wave-function-collapse-map.git`
   * Navigate to the project directory: `cd big_forest_tiles`
2. **Usage:**
