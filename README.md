# Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Project

## Overview

This project explores the concept of Wave Function Collapse (WFC) in the context of tile-based procedural generation. The WFC algorithm is implemented to generate diverse and realistic-looking patterns from a set of input tiles, showcasing its applications in computer graphics, game development, and procedural content generation.

## Features

* **Tile-based Generation:** Input a set of tiles with predefined patterns and let the WFC algorithm create complex, non-repetitive structures.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Adjust various parameters such as input tileset, output size, constraints, and output diversity to tailor the generation process.
* **Visualization Tools:** Visualize the generated output, explore different configurations, and analyze the WFC algorithm's behavior.
* **Integration Examples:** Includes integration examples and APIs for incorporating WFC-generated content into applications or games.

## Input Data

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm in this project operates on a set of 57 pictures. Each picture is either 100x100 pixels or 3200x3200 pixels in size, depending on the version of the dataset used. These pictures serve as the input tiles for the algorithm, contributing to the variety and complexity of the generated patterns.
